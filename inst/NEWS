CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.4
--------------------------

NEW FEATURES
o Add a OnlyPreprocess option for performing only the pre-processing step of the input sam file.  
This step writes two files: one file named 'prefix.instance' and one other named 'prefix.totalnumread',
where 'prefix' is the prefix of the input sam file.
The 'prefix.instance' file can then be given to the option 'preprocess.instance'
and the total number of mapped reads is stored in the 'prefix.totalnumread' file.

o Allow to give NN (total number of mapped fragments) even when using the sam file as input.
This can be used to run flipflop in parallel on parsed sam files with the same NN constant. 

USER-LEVEL CHANGES
o Handle '~' in input paths with path.expand function.

o Give a more detailed R output with the read count.

MINOR CHANGES
o Do not write individual Coverage into the pre-processing file anymore ie, the .instance file.
(in practice comments lines in readgroup.cpp, part 'toStream')



CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.2
--------------------------

BUG FIXES
o Switch from GRangeList to a regular list as the number of metadata columns could not vary in GRangeList.
