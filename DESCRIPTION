Description: Flipflop discovers which isoforms of a gene are expressed
        in a given sample together with their abundances, based on
        RNA-Seq read data. It takes an alignment file in SAM format as input.
	It can also discover transcripts from several samples simultaneously, 
	increasing statistical power.
